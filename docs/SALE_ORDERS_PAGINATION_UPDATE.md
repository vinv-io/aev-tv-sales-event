# Sale Orders Report Pagination Update

## âœ… Changes Made

### Updated Pagination Logic
- **Changed from**: Paginating by individual product rows (20 items per page)
- **Changed to**: Paginating by complete orders (10 full orders per page)

### Key Improvements

1. **Order-Based Pagination**:
   - New constant: `ORDERS_PER_PAGE = 10`
   - Pagination now works with complete orders instead of individual product rows
   - Each page shows up to 10 complete orders with all their products

2. **Better Data Flow**:
   ```typescript
   // Before: Paginate flattened rows
   const paginatedOrders = flattenedOrdersForDisplay.slice(...)
   
   // After: Paginate orders first, then flatten
   const paginatedFilteredOrders = filteredOrders.slice(...)
   const flattenedOrdersForDisplay = paginatedFilteredOrders.flatMap(...)
   ```

3. **Enhanced UI Feedback**:
   - Pagination footer now shows: `"Page 1 of 2 (15 orders total, showing 10)"`
   - Clear indication of how many orders are being displayed

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved

**Before**: Order `ORD1754745654255` had its products split across pages:
- PACK_3 on page 1 
- PACK_5 on page 2

**After**: Complete orders stay together:
- Both PACK_3 and PACK_5 appear on the same page
- Orders are never split across page boundaries

## ðŸ“Š Benefits

1. **Complete Order Visibility**: Users always see all products within an order together
2. **Better UX**: No confusion about missing products in split orders  
3. **Logical Pagination**: Page navigation works by complete business entities (orders)
4. **Consistent Grouping**: Maintains visual order grouping with rowspan

## ðŸ”„ Technical Details

- Maintains existing export functionality (exports all filtered orders)
- Preserves rowspan logic for visual order grouping
- Backward compatible with existing UI components
- No database changes required

The pagination now properly handles complete orders as atomic units, ensuring that multi-product orders like yours are never split across pages.

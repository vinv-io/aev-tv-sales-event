# Product Price Removal Summary

## âœ… Completed Changes

### Database Schema Changes
- **No changes to Prisma schema required** - The Product model in `prisma/schema.prisma` did not contain a price field

### Domain Entity Updates
- **Package Entity** (`src/domain/entities/Package.ts`)
  - Removed `price` field from constructor
  - Removed `getFinalPrice()` method
  - Removed `getDiscountPercentage()` method
  - Updated `toPlainObject()` and `fromPlainObject()` methods

- **Order Entity** (`src/domain/entities/Order.ts`)
  - Removed `unitPrice` field from product objects
  - Removed `calculateSubtotal()` method (total amount is now managed at order level)

### Application Layer Updates
- **Package Use Cases** (`src/application/use-cases/PackageUseCases.ts`)
  - Removed `price` field from `CreatePackageRequest` and `UpdatePackageRequest` interfaces
  - Removed price validation in `CreatePackageUseCase` and `UpdatePackageUseCase`
  - Removed `GetPackagesByPriceRangeUseCase` entirely

- **Order Use Cases** (`src/application/use-cases/OrderUseCases.ts`)
  - Removed `unitPrice` field from product arrays in interfaces
  - Added `totalAmount` field to `CreateOrderRequest` and `UpdateOrderRequest`
  - Updated validation to check totalAmount instead of calculating from unitPrice
  - Simplified order creation and updates to use provided totalAmount

- **Package Application Service** (`src/application/services/PackageApplicationService.ts`)
  - Removed `getPackagesByPriceRange()` method
  - Removed import and usage of `GetPackagesByPriceRangeUseCase`

### Repository Layer Updates
- **Package Repository Interface** (`src/domain/repositories/IPackageRepository.ts`)
  - Removed `findByPriceRange()` method signature

- **Package Repository Implementation** (`src/infrastructure/repositories/PackageRepositoryImpl.ts`)
  - Removed `findByPriceRange()` method implementation

### Data Layer Updates
- **Seed Data** (`prisma/seed.ts`)
  - Removed `unitPrice` field from all order products
  - Kept `total` field for individual product line items

- **Clean Actions** (`src/lib/data/clean-actions.ts`)
  - Updated `createOrderAction` to expect and use `totalAmount` from form data

## ðŸ“Š Impact Summary

### What Was Removed:
- Individual product pricing in domain models
- Price-based package filtering and search functionality
- Unit price calculations in order processing
- Price validation business rules

### What Remains:
- Order total amounts at the order level
- Product quantity tracking
- Total amounts in order line items (for reporting)

### Business Logic Changes:
- **Orders**: Now require a pre-calculated total amount instead of computing from unit prices
- **Packages**: Focus on product bundles without pricing concerns
- **Reporting**: Can still track order totals and revenue, but not unit-level pricing

## ðŸŽ¯ System Benefits

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Removed price calculation complexity from domain layer
2. **Flexible Pricing**: External systems can handle pricing logic independently
3. **Reduced Validation**: Less business rule validation around price consistency
4. **Cleaner Data Model**: Focus on product quantities and order totals

## ðŸ”„ Migration Notes

- **Database**: No migration required as price fields were not in the core schema
- **Existing Orders**: Total amounts are preserved, only unit price details removed
- **Frontend**: Forms must now calculate and provide totalAmount for orders
- **API**: Endpoints expecting price data need to be updated to use totalAmount

The system now operates without individual product pricing, focusing on order-level totals and product quantities. This simplifies the domain model while maintaining essential business functionality.

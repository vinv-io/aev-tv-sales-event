# AEV TV Sales Promo - Performance Optimization Guide

## 🚀 Performance Best Practices Implemented

### 1. **React Performance Optimizations**

#### Component Memoization
- All major components wrapped with `React.memo()`
- Memoized sub-components for complex UI sections
- `useMemo()` for expensive calculations
- `useCallback()` for event handlers

#### Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
- Error boundaries with graceful fallbacks
- Suspense boundaries for loading states
- Dynamic imports for large components

#### State Management Optimization
- Enhanced Layout Context with localStorage persistence
- Optimized cart actions with proper state updates
- Computed values with memoization
- Local state vs global state separation

### 2. **Header Component Optimizations**

#### Performance Features
- Memoized navigation links and computed values
- Optimized re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- Mobile-responsive design with accessibility features
- Sticky positioning with backdrop blur effects

#### Accessibility Improvements
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly content
- Focus management for mobile menu

### 3. **Footer Component Enhancements**

#### Structure & Performance
- Internationalized content with next-intl
- Semantic HTML structure
- Optimized link handling with proper external link indicators
- Responsive grid layout with proper spacing

#### SEO & Accessibility
- Proper semantic tags (`<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<address>`)
- Contact information with clickable links
- Social media integration ready

### 4. **Layout Context Improvements**

#### State Management
- Persistent cart and customer data (localStorage)
- Optimized actions with reduced re-renders
- Computed properties for better performance
- Proper error handling and recovery

#### Type Safety
- Enhanced TypeScript interfaces
- Better error messages and validation
- Proper null/undefined handling

### 5. **Error Handling & User Experience**

#### Error Boundaries
- Custom ErrorBoundary implementation
- Graceful degradation for component failures
- User-friendly error messages with retry functionality
- Development vs production error handling

#### Loading States
- Consistent loading spinners
- Skeleton screens for better perceived performance
- Proper loading state management

### 6. **Internationalization Best Practices**

#### Translation Structure
- Organized translation files by feature
- Consistent key naming conventions
- Fallback handling for missing translations
- Type-safe translation usage

#### Locale Management
- Proper locale routing with Next.js
- SEO-friendly URL structure
- Browser language detection

## 🎯 Performance Monitoring

### Development Tools
- Performance monitoring hook for render times
- Component lifecycle tracking
- Console warnings for slow renders (>16ms)
- Memory usage optimization

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint rules for performance
- Accessibility auditing ready
- Bundle size optimization

## 🛠 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
```bash
Node.js 18+
npm or yarn
```

### Installation
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Environment Configuration
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_LOCALE=vi
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORTED_LOCALES=vi,en
```

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Breakpoints
- Mobile: 320px - 768px
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px
- Desktop: 1024px+

### Design Principles
- Mobile-first approach
- Touch-friendly interactive elements
- Optimized font sizes and spacing
- Proper viewport configuration

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### Data Handling
- Client-side validation with server-side verification
- Proper error message sanitization
- localStorage data encryption ready
- XSS protection measures

### External Links
- `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security
- Proper target handling
- Link validation

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Performance Testing
- Core Web Vitals monitoring
- Bundle size analysis
- Runtime performance profiling
- Memory leak detection

### Accessibility Testing
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Color contrast validation
- WCAG 2.1 compliance

## 📈 Metrics to Monitor

### Core Web Vitals
- **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint): < 2.5s
- **FID** (First Input Delay): < 100ms
- **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift): < 0.1

### Custom Metrics
- Component render times
- State update frequency
- Memory usage patterns
- Error rates

# Folder Structure Reorganization Summary

## ✅ Completed Reorganization

Your project has been successfully reorganized following Next.js and React best practices. Here's what was accomplished:

### 📁 New Folder Structure

### 🔄 Key Changes Made

1. **Types Organization**
   - Extracted all types from scattered files
   - Created dedicated type files with clear separation
   - Added proper barrel exports for easy importing

2. **Service Layer**
   - Created business logic layer with EventService, ProductService, CustomerService
   - Separated concerns between data access and business logic
   - Implemented proper error handling and type safety

3. **Component Reorganization**
   - Moved Header and Footer to `layout/` directory
   - Moved LanguageSwitcher to `navigation/` directory
   - Moved Logo to `icons/` directory
   - Added barrel exports for cleaner imports

4. **Actions Refactoring**
   - Updated `src/lib/data/actions.ts` to use new service layer
   - Maintained server action functionality
   - Added proper type safety with new type definitions

5. **Import Updates**
   - Updated all import statements to use new paths
   - Enhanced TypeScript path mapping in `tsconfig.json`
   - Fixed component imports across all files

6. **Documentation**
   - Moved README.md and other docs to `docs/` directory
   - Organized project documentation

### 🛠️ Updated TypeScript Configuration

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"],
      "@/types": ["./src/types"],
      "@/types/*": ["./src/types/*"],
      "@/services": ["./src/services"],
      "@/services/*": ["./src/services/*"],
      "@/components/*": ["./src/components/*"],
      "@/lib/*": ["./src/lib/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 🎯 Benefits Achieved

1. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between types, services, and components
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify specific functionality
3. **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Better IntelliSense and auto-imports
4. **Scalability**: Structure supports easy addition of new features
5. **Type Safety**: Centralized types prevent inconsistencies
6. **Code Reusability**: Service layer promotes DRY principles

### 📝 Notes

- All TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Backward compatibility maintained during migration
- Original files backed up (e.g., `actions-backup.ts`)
- Ready for further development with new structure

### 🚀 Next Steps

The reorganization is complete! You can now:
- Continue development using the new organized structure
- Add new features following the established patterns
- Enjoy improved code organization and maintainability
